# Authorship Attribution For Arabic Books Using Deep Learning

The objective of this project is to investigate the application of Deep Learning algorithms and create a model for Arabic authorship attribution with a recommender system on top. Authorship attribution refers to the process of identifying the writer of a piece of text as input.

On the top of identifying the writer, we create a recommnder system to tell what books are similar from the transformer output or user input.
